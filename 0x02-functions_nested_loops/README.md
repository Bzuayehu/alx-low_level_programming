# C - Functions, nested loops :page_with_curl: 0x02-functions_nested_loops
## About this project :
In this project i learnt and practiced;
- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`
- What are header files and how to to use them with `#include`
## Tasks file description:
 * [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all
  functions written in the project

 * [0-holberton.c](./0-holberton.c): C program that prints `Holberton`, followed by a
  new line. Returns 0.

  * [1-alphabet.c](./1-alphabet.c): C function that prints the alphabet in lowercase,
  followed by a new line.

  * [2-print_alphabet_x10.c](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c): C function that prints the
  alphabet in lowercase 10 times, followed by a new line.

  * [3-islower.c](./3-islower.c): C function that checks for lowercase characters.
  Returns `1` if the character is lowercase, `0` otherwise.
  
  * [4-isalpha.c](./4-isalpha.c): C function that checks for alphabetic characters.
  Returns `1` if the character is a letter, `0` otherwise.

  * [5-sign.c](./5-sign.c): C function that prints the sign of a number. Returns:
    * `1` and prints `+` if the number is greater than zero.
    * `0` and prints `0` if the number is zero.
    * `-1` and prints `-` if the number is less than zero.

  * [6-abs.c](./6-abs.c): C function that returns the absolute value of an integer.

  * [7-print_last_digit.c](./7-print_last_digit.c): C function that prints the last
  digit of a number. Returns the value of the last digit.

  * [8-24_hours.c](./8-24_hours.c): C function that prints every minute of the day
  of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

  * [9-times_table.c](./9-times_table.c): C function that prints the 9 times table,
  starting with 0.

  * [10-add.c](./10-add.c): C function that returns the addition of two integers.

  * [11-print_to_98.c](./11-print_to_98.c): C function that prints all natural numbers
  from an input to `98` followed by a new line, as follows:
    * Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.
    * Numbers are printed in order.
    * Input represents the number to begin counting from.
    * `98` is the last number printed.

  * [100-times_table.c](./100-times_table.c): C function that prints the times table of
  an input value, starting with 0:
    * If input is greater than `15` or less than `0`, function prints nothing.

  * [101-natural.c](./101-natural.c): C program that computes and prints the sum of
  all multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded).

  * [102-fibonacci.c](./102-fibonacci.c): C program that prints the first 50
  Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line.
  Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.

  * [103-fibonacci.c](./103-fibonacci.c): C program that prints the sum of even-valued
  Fibonacci numbers not exceeding 4,000,000, followed by a new line.
  
  * [104-fibonacci.c](./104-fibonacci.c): C program that prints the first 98 Fibonacci
  numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line, without using `long long`,
  `malloc`, pointers, arrays, structures, or any library besides the standard.
  Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.
